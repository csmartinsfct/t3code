# T3 Managed Runs

Managed Runs let T3 Code track long-running services (dev servers, docker compose, build watchers, etc.) with lifecycle management, log capture, and service health monitoring — instead of letting them disappear into raw terminal sessions.

## Overview

The system has four main moving parts:

1. **Actions** — saved project scripts (name + command + icon + declared services).
2. **MCP server** — an HTTP endpoint that AI providers call to list, launch, inspect, and propose runs.
3. **Injected system prompt** — tells the AI model about managed runs so it uses the MCP tools instead of raw `bash`.
4. **Web UI** — shows active runs, service health, completion toasts, and interactive proposal cards.

## Actions (Project Scripts)

An **action** is a saved script associated with a project. Actions are what the AI launches via `launch_project_script`.

### Schema

```typescript
ProjectScript {
  id: string           // kebab-case, auto-generated from name
  name: string         // "Dev Server", "Run Tests", etc.
  command: string      // "npm run dev", "docker compose up", etc.
  icon: "play" | "test" | "lint" | "configure" | "build" | "debug"
  runOnWorktreeCreate: boolean
  services?: DeclaredService[]  // services this command launches
}
```

Defined in `packages/contracts/src/orchestration.ts`.

### Storage

Actions are persisted through the orchestration event-sourcing pipeline:

1. Client dispatches a `project.meta.update` command (with a `scripts` array).
2. The decider (`apps/server/src/orchestration/decider.ts`) produces a `project.meta-updated` event.
3. The projection pipeline persists scripts into the SQLite projection table.
4. The web client reduces `project.meta-updated` events into its in-memory store.

### How actions get created

There are two paths:

- **Manual:** The user configures actions directly through the project settings UI.
- **AI-proposed:** The AI calls `propose_project_script`, which renders an interactive card in chat where the user can review, edit, and accept/reject the proposal. On accept, the client dispatches `project.meta.update` and sends a confirmation message back to the AI: `"Action added: {name} (id: {id}, command: {command})"`.

---

## MCP Server

The managed runs MCP server is a stateless JSON-RPC endpoint at `POST /mcp/managed-runs`.

### Implementation

`apps/server/src/managedRuns/http.ts`

The server uses the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and bridges async MCP tool callbacks into the Effect runtime via a work queue pattern (`createEffectBridge()`). This is necessary because MCP tool handlers run in async-land but managed run operations need the Effect fiber's SQLite connection scope.

### Authentication

Each provider session gets a short-lived bearer token via `managedRunService.issueMcpAccess(projectId, threadId)`. The token maps back to `{projectId, threadId}` when the MCP server receives a request.

### Tools

| Tool                     | Purpose                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_managed_runs`      | List active (and optionally historical) runs for the project. Check before launching to avoid duplicates.                       |
| `launch_project_script`  | Launch an action as a managed run. Fails if a run for the same script is already active.                                        |
| `get_managed_run`        | Get full metadata and evidence for a run (detected URLs, ports, docker info).                                                   |
| `get_managed_run_logs`   | Read timestamped log lines. Supports `stream` filter and `tailLines`.                                                           |
| `stop_managed_run`       | Stop an active run.                                                                                                             |
| `propose_project_script` | Propose a new action. Returns a JSON payload that the AI must include as a ` ```t3:propose-action ` code block in its response. |

### MCP config injection into providers

When a provider session starts and the thread belongs to a project:

- **Claude adapter** (`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/ClaudeAdapter.ts`): Passes `mcpServers` config with the `t3_managed_runs` server URL + bearer token, auto-allows `mcp__t3_managed_runs__*` tools, and appends the system prompt.
- **Codex adapter** (`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/CodexAdapter.ts`): Sets `mcp_servers.t3_managed_runs.url` and `http_headers.Authorization` via config overrides, and appends the system prompt via `appendDeveloperInstructions`.

---

## Injected System Prompt

`apps/server/src/managedRuns/systemPrompt.ts`

When MCP is configured, a system prompt section is appended to the AI's instructions:

1. Call `list_managed_runs` first to check what's already running.
2. Use `launch_project_script` for existing actions.
3. Use `propose_project_script` for new actions.
4. **Never** start long-running services via bash directly.
5. When proposing, **always** declare services with health checks.

The prompt includes examples for common patterns (npm run dev, docker compose, supabase start).

---

## Run Lifecycle

### States

```
starting → running → completed (exit 0)
                   → failed    (non-zero exit)
                   → stopped   (user/AI stopped it)
                   → lost      (process disappeared)
```

### Launch flow

1. `launchProjectScript()` creates a run record in SQLite with status `"starting"`.
2. A PTY terminal (120x30) is spawned with the script command.
3. Environment variables injected: `T3CODE_PROJECT_ROOT`, `T3CODE_WORKTREE_PATH`.
4. Output is captured to an NDJSON log file (each line: `{timestamp, stream, line}`).
5. After a 1.5s startup grace period, status moves to `"running"`.
6. Evidence is collected: process PID, detected URLs/ports from output, docker containers.

### Log retention

Logs are retained for 48 hours (`LOG_RETENTION_MS`). A background fiber cleans up expired logs every hour.

---

## Service Health Checks

When an action declares services, T3 monitors each one independently. This is critical for commands that exit after starting background services (e.g. `docker compose up -d`, `npx supabase start`).

### Health check types

| Type      | How it works                             | Timeout |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `url`     | HTTP GET, any 2xx = healthy              | 5s      |
| `docker`  | `docker inspect` + check `State.Running` | 5s      |
| `port`    | TCP socket connect attempt               | 3s      |
| `command` | Shell exec, exit code 0 = healthy        | 10s     |

Implementation: `apps/server/src/managedRuns/healthCheck.ts`

### Polling

Health checks run every 12 seconds (`HEALTH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`). Status changes are stored in the database and published to connected clients via WebSocket.

---

## Web UI

### Runs Control (`ManagedRunsControl.tsx`)

A menu button in the toolbar showing:

- Run count badge
- List of active runs with status badges
- Per-service health indicators (green/red/gray dots)
- Service summary (e.g. "2/3 services up")
- Detected URL or truncated command as secondary text

### Propose Action Card (`ProposeActionCard.tsx`)

When the AI includes a ` ```t3:propose-action ` code block in its response, the markdown renderer detects it (via `isProposeActionBlock()` in `apps/web/src/lib/proposeActionParser.ts`) and renders an interactive card:

- Editable name and command fields
- Icon picker (play, test, lint, configure, build, debug)
- Declared services list with health check type icons
- Accept / Reject buttons

On accept:

1. The client dispatches `project.meta.update` with the new script added.
2. A confirmation message is injected: `"Action added: {name} (id: {id}, command: {command})"`.
3. The AI can then call `launch_project_script` to start it.

### Completion Toasts (`useManagedRunCompletionToasts.ts`)

Subscribes to `ManagedRunStreamEvent` via WebSocket. When a run reaches a terminal state:

| Status    | Toast type | Behavior                         |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Failed    | Error      | Persistent, with "Ask AI" button |
| Completed | Success    | Auto-dismiss after 8s            |
| Stopped   | Info       | Auto-dismiss after 5s            |
| Lost      | Warning    | Auto-dismiss after 8s            |

The **"Ask AI" button** on failure toasts:

1. Fetches the last 50 log lines via `managedRuns.getLogs`.
2. Builds a prompt with the command, exit code, and output.
3. Creates a new thread with the prompt pre-filled.
4. Navigates to the new thread.

### WebSocket streaming

The client subscribes via `subscribeManagedRunEvents(projectId)` and receives:

- `snapshot` events on initial subscribe (seeds the run list)
- `upserted` events as runs change (status transitions, health check updates)
